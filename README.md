### Project Description
The AI-Based Attendance Management System uses facial recognition technology to automatically record student attendance. The system captures images through a camera, detects and recognizes faces using AI algorithms, and matches them with a stored database to mark attendance accurately.

It reduces manual effort, prevents proxy attendance, and stores records digitally for easy monitoring and analysis. This smart solution improves efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in educational institutions.

### The Problem statement
Proxy and time consuming attendance system 

### The Solution
Ai Based Attendance Management System
